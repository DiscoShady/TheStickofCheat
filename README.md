# The Stick of Cheat
An external game hack (trainer) written in C# for the latest Steam version (as of 7/3/2015) of South Park: The Stick of Truth.

This is my first project created in C#. I created it so I could learn more about the creation of game hacks, memory editing, and reverse engineering. 

It may also serve as an introduction on how to use BinarySharp or other general memory editing classes for those who want to also learn about external game hacking and reverse engineering.
